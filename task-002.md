# Task-002: Monitor Tools

I need tools which allow me to debug functions that are nested in compose or pipe workflows.

# Todo

- [ ] Need to think about how parameters are set

# Requirements

- robust, the logging must not cause the function to fail
- wrapping should be easy
- allow for deactivation(even removal) so that it doesn't affect performance
- random selection for testing
